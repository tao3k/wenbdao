## 💎 Why Wendao? (The Obsidian Leap)

Wendao moves beyond the limitations of traditional bi-link tools by introducing **Topological Sovereignty**:

| Feature         | Obsidian (Human-Centric)    | **Wendao (Agent-Centric)**                        |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Structure**   | Flat Bi-links & Folders     | **Hierarchical Semantic Trees (PageIndex)**       |
| **Retrieval**   | Simple Search / Dataview    | **Quantum Fusion (Vector + Graph + PPR)**         |
| **Scale**       | Electron / Local Filesystem | **Rust Core / LanceDB / Valkey Cluster**          |
| **Context**     | Manual "Maps of Content"    | **Automated Ancestry Uplink (Zero-loss context)** |
| **Performance** | Sequential scanning         | **Arrow-Native Zero-Copy (15x throughput)**       |

## 🚀 Key Evolutionary Features

### 1. PageIndex Rust Core (Hierarchical Indexing)

Unlike Obsidian's flat structure, Wendao builds a recursive **Semantic Tree** of your documents. It understands the logical hierarchy (Root > Chapter > Section), allowing agents to navigate complex long-form content with "God's eye" perspective.

### 2. Quantum Fusion (Hybrid Retrieval)

Fuses fuzzy **Vector Search** (semantic intuition) with precise **Graph Diffusion** (logical reasoning). Using a neurobiologically inspired **PPR algorithm** (Personalized PageRank), Wendao finds not just "similar" text, but "logically relevant" knowledge clusters.

### 3. Apache Arrow Flight

Built on top of the **Arrow Data Ecosystem**. Knowledge flows through the engine as columnar memory batches. This ensures **Zero-copy** overhead during retrieval, re-ranking, and injection, making it capable of handling millions of nodes at sub-millisecond latency.

The business boundary is now pure Arrow Flight. The outward HTTP business
surfaces `/api/search/{intent,attachments,references,symbols,ast}` and
`/api/analysis/{markdown,code-ast}` are retired.

The canonical business contracts are:

- `/search/intent`
- `/search/attachments`
- `/search/references`
- `/search/symbols`
- `/search/ast`
- `/analysis/markdown`
- `/analysis/code-ast`

The stable runtime metadata keys are:

- `x-wendao-search-query`
- `x-wendao-search-limit`
- `x-wendao-analysis-path`
- `x-wendao-analysis-repo`
- `x-wendao-analysis-line`

The bundled OpenAPI artifact now keeps only the JSON control plane for these
families. The semantic Flight search contract is pinned by
`tests/snapshots/gateway/studio/search_flight_service_route_contracts.snap`.
`/api/ui/capabilities` no longer advertises a browser search Arrow transport,
because there is no remaining browser-facing search Arrow business surface.

The same `analysis/` folder is now also split by lane internally:

- `analysis/service/markdown.rs`
- `analysis/service/code_ast.rs`
- `analysis/types/markdown.rs`
- `analysis/types/code_ast.rs`

This keeps the canonical Flight routes unchanged while removing the remaining
mixed `service.rs` and `types.rs` internals.

The old `analysis_exports.rs` forwarding hop is also gone now. Handler-level
barrels re-export the canonical analysis routes directly from the `analysis`
feature folder instead of bouncing through a second legacy file.

The same cleanup pattern has now started on the remaining handler families:
the old `capabilities_exports.rs` forwarding hop is gone, and
`handlers/mod.rs` re-exports `get_ui_capabilities` and `get_plugin_artifact`
directly from the `capabilities` feature folder.

The same is now true for UI config: `ui_config_exports.rs` is gone, and
`handlers/mod.rs` re-exports `get_ui_config` / `set_ui_config` directly from
the `ui_config` handler module without changing the outward route names.

The same cleanup now also covers VFS: `vfs_exports.rs` is gone, and
`handlers/mod.rs` re-exports `vfs_root_entries`, `vfs_scan`, `vfs_cat`,
`vfs_resolve`, and `vfs_entry` directly from the `vfs` handler module. During
that cleanup, the checked-in bundled OpenAPI artifact was also brought back
into sync with the declared route inventory by restoring the generic plugin
artifact inspection path.

The same direct re-export pattern now also covers graph handlers:
`graph_exports.rs` is gone, and `handlers/mod.rs` re-exports
`graph_neighbors`, `node_neighbors`, and `topology_3d` directly from the
`graph` feature folder.

Current fit audit for the remaining search-family Flight contracts is explicit:

- `references`: fits the generic Flight search seam (`query + limit`)
- `symbols`: fits the generic Flight search seam (`query + limit`)
- `attachments`: does not fit the generic seam because it requires `ext`,
  `kind`, and `case_sensitive`, so it now uses its own dedicated attachment
  Flight provider seam instead
- `ast`: not a clean generic-seam candidate; it is tied to the local
  symbol-index path, so the canonical surface is the dedicated Flight route
  `/search/ast` backed by its own AST provider seam

That audit result is now reflected in the runtime substrate. The generic
Flight search matcher no longer claims `/search/attachments` or `/search/ast`.
`xiuxian-wendao-runtime` now exposes a dedicated attachment-search Flight
contract with explicit metadata headers for `ext`, `kind`, and
`case_sensitive`, plus a separate `AttachmentSearchFlightRouteProvider`
boundary, and a separate `AstSearchFlightRouteProvider` boundary for the
local symbol-index path. The semantic search contract is now locked by the
Studio Flight snapshot suite rather than by browser Arrow IPC routes.

### Julia Arrow Adapter

`xiuxian-wendao` now exposes a thin Julia-facing service adapter for the
WendaoArrow transport contract. The core crate keeps the existing synchronous
repository analyzer trait unchanged, while `analyzers::fetch_julia_flight_score_rows_for_repository`
provides an explicit async entrypoint for:

- resolving repository-configured Julia Flight transport settings
- executing the Arrow Flight roundtrip
- validating the WendaoArrow `v1` response contract
- materializing `doc_id`, `analyzer_score`, and `final_score` into typed Rust rows

The same boundary now also exposes `analyzers::build_julia_arrow_request_batch`
and `analyzers::JuliaArrowRequestRow`, so higher-level retrieval code can build
the canonical WendaoArrow `v1` request payload without duplicating Arrow schema
construction.

That contract surface now also exports canonical request/response column-name
constants such as `JULIA_ARROW_DOC_ID_COLUMN`,
`JULIA_ARROW_VECTOR_SCORE_COLUMN`, `JULIA_ARROW_ANALYZER_SCORE_COLUMN`, and
`JULIA_ARROW_FINAL_SCORE_COLUMN`, so downstream crates do not need to repeat
WendaoArrow field-name literals.

The same module now also exposes `julia_arrow_request_schema(...)` and
`julia_arrow_response_schema(...)`, so request/response fixtures can share one
typed Arrow schema definition instead of rebuilding the WendaoArrow `v1`
contract from repeated `Field::new(...)` literals.

For link-graph semantic retrieval, `VectorStoreSemanticIgnition` now also
provides `build_julia_rerank_request_batch(...)`, which reuses anchor ids as
the stable request-row identity and assembles a Julia-ready Arrow batch from
`QuantumAnchorHit` values plus the current query vector.

`OpenAiCompatibleSemanticIgnition` now exposes the same
`build_julia_rerank_request_batch(...)` surface. It resolves the effective
query vector from either an explicit `query_vector` or an
OpenAI-compatible embedding call, then builds the canonical WendaoArrow `v1`
request batch from the resulting anchors and stored embeddings.

For the link-graph runtime, `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank` is now the
dedicated config namespace for the future WendaoArrow post-processing step.
The runtime currently resolves `base_url`, `route`, `health_route`,
`schema_version`, and `timeout_secs`, and planned-search payloads now keep a
separate `julia_rerank` telemetry slot so remote Julia transport state stays
separate from `semantic_ignition`.

The OpenAI-compatible semantic-ignition runtime path now uses that config as an
optional post-processing stage. When configured, Wendao can build the
WendaoArrow `v1` request batch, call the remote Julia service, validate the
Arrow response contract, and overwrite `QuantumContext.saliency_score` with the
returned Julia `final_score`. Transport or contract failures degrade cleanly
back to the original Rust-side quantum-fusion ordering and are recorded in
`julia_rerank` telemetry.

That runtime path is now covered by a planned-search loopback integration test
that keeps a local mock only for `/v1/embeddings`, but sends the rerank Arrow
IPC request to the real `.data/WendaoArrow` Julia service, then asserts the
Julia `final_score` response actually reorders emitted `quantum_contexts`.

The vector-store semantic-ignition backend can now enter the same Julia rerank
path when the caller provides a precomputed query vector through the planned
search runtime. Wendao keeps that vector in the in-memory payload runtime state
only, uses it to build the WendaoArrow request batch, and still avoids
serializing it into the external payload contract.

That vector-store runtime path is also now covered against the real
`.data/WendaoArrow` Julia service rather than a Rust-side Arrow mock.

There is now also a dedicated planned-search integration that targets the
package-owned `.data/WendaoArrow/scripts/run_stream_scoring_server.sh`
example, so the main crate validates not only custom Julia rerank responses
but also the official stream scoring example surface.

A second package-owned integration now targets
`.data/WendaoAnalyzer/scripts/run_stream_linear_blend_server.sh`, so the main
crate also validates the first real analyzer package surface instead of only
transport-layer examples.

The Julia rerank runtime config can now also express analyzer-owned strategy
selection fields:

- `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank.service_mode`
- `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank.analyzer_config_path`
- `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank.analyzer_strategy`
- `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank.vector_weight`
- `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank.similarity_weight`

These fields are additive. They do not change the Arrow transport contract, and
they are currently validated through main integration coverage against the
analyzer-owned test server surface. `LinkGraphJuliaRerankRuntimeConfig` now
comes from the Julia-owned compatibility surface, while `xiuxian-wendao`
keeps only the re-export seam. That runtime record also exposes
`analyzer_service_descriptor()` so Rust-side code can derive the analyzer-owned
launch contract without repeating field mapping. The same runtime surface now
also exposes `analyzer_launch_manifest()`, which resolves the generic analyzer
launcher path and ordered Julia CLI args into one Julia-owned manifest.

For analyzer-owned deployments, the current service contract is intentionally
split:

- `xiuxian-wendao` owns remote Julia rerank addressing through
  `link_graph.retrieval.julia_rerank.*`
- `WendaoAnalyzer` owns analyzer strategy flags such as
  `--analyzer-config`, `--analyzer-strategy`, `--vector-weight`, and
  `--similarity-weight`
- remaining HTTP and Arrow transport flags are still passed through to
  `WendaoArrow`

The Rust integration support now consumes that launch manifest directly, so it
no longer has to hardcode the analyzer launcher script name or hand-assemble
ordered Julia args from repeated field mapping.

The same runtime surface now also exposes `deployment_artifact()`, which
packages the resolved transport coordinates and analyzer launch manifest into
one serializable artifact suitable for inspection or persistence. That
artifact now also owns `to_toml_string()` and `write_toml_file(...)`, so
runtime assembly can export the resolved Julia deployment contract without
repeating serialization or file-write conventions outside `xiuxian-wendao`.
The deployment artifact now also carries artifact-level inspection metadata:
`artifact_schema_version` identifies the artifact contract itself, while
`generated_at` records when a concrete JSON/TOML export instance was rendered.
On top of that, the remaining Julia-shaped launch and deployment DTOs are now
package-owned by `xiuxian-wendao-julia`, so callers that still need the
legacy Julia compatibility records should import them from the Julia package
rather than from `xiuxian-wendao` crate-root shims.

For downstream Rust imports:

- prefer `xiuxian_wendao_julia::compatibility::link_graph::*` for Julia-owned
  deployment and launch compatibility DTOs such as
  `LinkGraphJuliaRerankRuntimeConfig` and
  `LinkGraphJuliaDeploymentArtifact`
- treat `xiuxian-wendao` itself as the owner of the generic plugin-artifact
  surfaces and runtime binding helpers
- do not expect a crate-root `xiuxian_wendao::compatibility::*` namespace;
  that host migration shim is retired

```rust
use xiuxian_wendao_julia::compatibility::link_graph::{
    DEFAULT_JULIA_ANALYZER_LAUNCHER_PATH, LinkGraphJuliaDeploymentArtifact,
    LinkGraphJuliaRerankRuntimeConfig,
};

let _ = core::mem::size_of::<LinkGraphJuliaRerankRuntimeConfig>();
let _ = core::mem::size_of::<LinkGraphJuliaDeploymentArtifact>();
let _launcher = DEFAULT_JULIA_ANALYZER_LAUNCHER_PATH;
```

For inspection surfaces, the same export is now visible through
`zhenfa_router` as `wendao.plugin_artifact`, which returns one resolved
artifact selected by `plugin_id` and `artifact_id` over the existing
native/RPC tool boundary. The tool defaults to TOML, also supports a
structured JSON variant via `output_format = "json"`, and accepts an optional
`output_path` for direct TOML or JSON export instead of only returning the
rendered payload inline.
Studio now also exposes the same resolved artifact at
`GET /api/ui/plugins/{plugin_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}`, returning the
structured generic plugin-artifact JSON directly from the gateway debug
surface. The same endpoint also accepts `?format=toml` for parity with the
tool-side inspection surface. That Studio inspection surface is now also
formalized in the gateway OpenAPI route inventory around the generic
`UiPluginArtifact` payload, so the debug endpoint no longer leaks the raw
link-graph runtime artifact struct directly.
The Studio JSON payload includes the same artifact-level metadata fields, so
UI/debug consumers can distinguish artifact-contract versioning from the
underlying WendaoArrow transport `schema_version`.
The current frontend consumer surface now also exposes this endpoint through
typed API client methods, so Qianji Studio can request either the structured
JSON artifact or the TOML inspection view without issuing raw fetch calls.
That same frontend consumer path is now also rendered in the Studio workspace
StatusBar as a Julia rerank inspection chip, so the resolved deployment
artifact is visible in the live UI shell instead of only through API/debug
consumers.
That live inspection chip now also offers direct frontend-side export actions
for `Copy TOML` and `Download JSON`, reusing the same Studio endpoint rather
than introducing a second deployment-debug surface.
On the frontend side, the artifact formatting and export orchestration now sit
behind one dedicated inspection feature folder instead of staying split across
the workspace shell and status-bar component.
That frontend inspection folder now also exposes a dedicated subview for the
artifact popover, so the workspace `StatusBar` can remain a thin orchestration
surface on the UI side as well.
The same frontend cleanup now also extracts the repo-index diagnostics
chip/popover into its own status-bar subview, so the main status shell is
consistently acting as composition/orchestration rather than inline popover
rendering.
That status-bar cleanup now also moves derived labels and tones behind a
frontend `statusBar/model.ts` helper, so the top-level shell is no longer
mixing derivation with final rendering assembly.
The Julia deployment inspection surface now also carries its own controller for
copy/download feedback state, further reducing the amount of local UI state
owned by the top-level StatusBar shell.

A second official-example integration now targets
`.data/WendaoArrow/scripts/run_stream_metadata_server.sh` to confirm additive
response columns derived from request metadata do not break the planned-search
Julia rerank path. The Julia response decoder now also surfaces optional
additive `trace_id` columns into `julia_rerank.trace_ids`, and the planned
search runtime writes a stable request-schema `trace_id` so the official
metadata example can roundtrip that context without changing the core
`doc_id / analyzer_score / final_score` contract.

The integration support layer now keeps those two concerns separate:

- custom-score tests launch a private Julia processor with explicit score maps
- official-example tests launch `.data/WendaoArrow/scripts/run_stream_scoring_server.sh`

At the request boundary, both `zhenfa_router::WendaoSearchRequest` and the
planned HTTP request surface now accept an optional `query_vector`. When
present, the router forwards it into the planned-search runtime so the
vector-store backend can participate in Julia rerank without requiring an
extra embedding call on the Rust side.

The same optional `query_vector` is now accepted by the native
`wendao.search` Zhenfa tool arguments, so direct tool callers and bridge-based
LLM flows can reuse the vector-store Julia rerank path without changing the
serialized planned-payload contract.

This keeps transport ownership in the Arrow substrate while giving future
gateway and reranking paths one stable Rust-side integration surface.

### Query Core Phase 1

Wendao now starts the RFC-defined query-core split with a new internal
`query_core` module. In this layout:

- `xiuxian-wendao` owns typed query operators, execution context, graph
  adapters, and explain or telemetry contracts
- `xiuxian-vector` owns reusable retrieval-row shaping and payload-projection
  helpers used by the query core

The currently landed Phase-1 slice is no longer only a skeleton:

- repo-scoped `repo_content` code search now routes through
  `query_core::query_repo_content_relation(...)`
- repo-scoped `repo_entity` code search now routes through
  `query_core::query_repo_entity_relation(...)`
- Studio graph handlers now route `graph_neighbors` and `node_neighbors`
  through query-core-native graph projections rather than handler-local Arrow
  relation decoding
- repo-scoped code-search telemetry for both `repo_content_chunk` and
  `repo_entity` is now reflected back into Search Plane status
- graph-side explain events now emit stable internal summaries through the
  existing logging path instead of remaining test-only
- graph query-core backend naming is now neutral and API-first:
  `LinkGraphBackend` and `SearchPlaneBackend` replace the old `legacy-*`
  labels inside explain events and tests
- handlers no longer need to hand-assemble execution context directly; a
  thin query-core service facade now owns the common adapter wiring
- repo-wide `code_search` task fanout now reuses one per-repo
  `search_repo_code_hits(...)` entrypoint, so the join-set scheduler is
  responsible only for concurrency and timeout control, not entity/content
  fallback semantics
- the repo-scoped code-search policy now also has a query-core service-level
  entrypoint. Entity-first fallback ordering and repo publication gating are
  no longer re-decided in the scheduling layer
- repo-scoped retrieval callers now exercise the full Phase-1 relation path:
  `vector_search -> column_mask -> payload_fetch`. `ColumnMaskOp` and
  `PayloadFetchOp` are no longer test-only operators
- query-core now also has direct service-level regressions for repo code-search
  corpus selection, so entity-preferred routing and content fallback are pinned
  below the handler layer
- query-core graph integration is now also projection-first. The new
  `query_core::graph` module owns `WendaoGraphProjection`,
  `WendaoGraphNode`, and `WendaoGraphLink`, while
  `query_core::query_graph_neighbors_projection(...)` lets Studio graph
  handlers consume one typed internal graph shape instead of parsing Arrow
  columns in the route layer
- the Studio graph handler cluster now also follows the same Phase-2 shared
  service rule as repo and docs. `graph_neighbors`, `node_neighbors`, and
  `topology_3d` route through one graph service boundary, so route files no
  longer own query-core projection execution, explain logging, or topology
  assembly directly
- the remaining graph shared-state surface is now closed too. `graph/shared/`
  separates graph-neighbor query parsing from graph rendering and topology
  helpers, and `graph/shared/mod.rs` is now interface-only like the other
  Phase-2 feature folders
- the graph test boundary now matches that production shape. `graph/tests/support/`
  separates fixture runtime, response helpers, assertions, and snapshot
  shaping, while `graph/tests/mod.rs` stays interface-only
- the router export seam now matches docs as well. `graph_exports.rs` owns the
  outward-facing graph handler exports, so `handlers/mod.rs` no longer carries
  a flat graph re-export block
- the repo router export seam now matches the same pattern. `repo_exports.rs`
  owns the outward-facing repo handler exports, so `handlers/mod.rs` no longer
  carries a flat repo re-export block either
- the same outward-facing export rule now also covers analysis handlers.
  `analysis_exports.rs` owns the public analysis handler exports, so
  `handlers/mod.rs` no longer carries a flat analysis re-export block
- the remaining top-level router seams are now closed as well.
  `capabilities_exports.rs`, `ui_config_exports.rs`, and `vfs_exports.rs`
  now own the outward-facing exports for those handler clusters, so
  `handlers/mod.rs` no longer carries any flat capability, UI-config, or VFS
  re-export blocks
- the analysis handler body is now closed too. `analysis/` separates markdown
  routes, code-AST routes, shared loader logic, and query types, while
  `analysis/mod.rs` stays interface-only
- the capabilities handler body now follows the same pattern. `capabilities/`
  separates UI-capabilities routes, deployment-artifact routes, and query
  types, while `capabilities/mod.rs` stays interface-only
- repo-analysis search handlers now route their repo-entity fast path through
  `query_core::service`, and the repeated cache plus fast-path plus analyzer
  fallback control flow is now centralized in one shared repo-analysis search
  service helper with typed `run_repo_module_search(...)`,
  `run_repo_symbol_search(...)`, and `run_repo_example_search(...)` entrypoints.
  `module-search`, `symbol-search`, and `example-search` no longer duplicate
  that orchestration inline
- that same shared repo-analysis service now also owns the typed route-facing
  entry contract end to end. The route files for module, symbol, and example
  search no longer carry route-local fallback-builder closures; they only parse
  request parameters and return `Json(...)` from the shared typed service
- the shared repo-analysis service now also owns a lower-level typed contract
  for query construction, query-core fast-path dispatch, and analyzer-artifact
  fallback binding. Module, symbol, and example flows now vary by typed
  contract metadata instead of carrying near-duplicate builder wiring
- that fallback contract ownership has now been pushed one layer lower into
  `analyzers::service::search`. Gateway-side repo-analysis orchestration now
  composes analyzer-owned fallback contracts with query-core fast paths instead
  of directly binding analyzer query builders and artifact result constructors
- the repo-analysis fast-path contract has now been pushed lower as well.
  `query_core::service` owns typed repo-entity fast-path contracts for module,
  symbol, and example result surfaces, and the shared gateway repo-analysis
  service now composes query-core-owned fast-path contracts with
  analyzer-owned fallback contracts rather than binding three separate
  repo-entity helper functions
- that same shared Phase-2 repo-analysis service now also owns
  `repo/import-search`. Studio routing and OpenAPI inventory expose the import
  lane, analyzer search owns the typed import fallback contract, and the route
  layer now validates both `MISSING_REPO` and `MISSING_IMPORT_FILTER`
- the import lane has now landed its next Phase-2 hardening milestone too.
  Import cache identity is derived from one canonical fallback-contract query
  text that preserves both `package` and `module`, so combined filters no
  longer collapse onto the same cached search key
- `repo/import-search` is now also repo-entity aware. Import rows are
  materialized on the repo-entity plane, query-core exposes a publication-gated
  typed import fast path, and the shared Phase-2 repo-analysis service now
  prefers that fast path before falling back to analyzer-owned import search
- query-search regression coverage now starts using snapshot baselines under
  `tests/snapshots/wendao/`. The first landed snapshots pin
  query-core repo-code results, query-core graph projections, and typed
  repo-entity module/symbol/example query outputs
- repo-analysis gateway coverage now also keeps Studio-level snapshot baselines
  under `tests/snapshots/gateway/studio/` for the shared repo-entity fast-path
  payloads returned by `module-search`, `symbol-search`, and `example-search`
  helper flows
- snapshot coverage now also includes analyzer import search output and the
  gateway-facing `repo/import-search` payload surface, so the import lane is
  pinned at both the analyzer contract layer and the Studio response layer
- import fast-path coverage now also includes a dedicated query-core snapshot
  plus a gateway regression proving `run_repo_import_search(...)` can succeed
  from repo-entity publication alone, without requiring repo-config fallback
- the same Phase-2 service-consolidation pattern now also covers the non-search
  repo-analysis endpoints. `repo/overview` and `repo/doc-coverage` now route
  through one shared analysis service boundary instead of each handler owning
  its own `with_repo_analysis(...)` orchestration
- projected retrieval handlers now follow the same rule. `projected_retrieval`,
  `projected_retrieval_hit`, `projected_retrieval_context`,
  `projected_page_index_tree_search`, and `projected_page_search` now sit
  behind one shared projected-service boundary instead of carrying repeated
  route-local analysis orchestration
- the same shared projected-service boundary now also owns the projected page
  lookup cluster. `projected_pages`, `projected_gap_report`,
  `projected_page`, `projected_page_index_tree`,
  `projected_page_index_node`, and `projected_page_index_trees` are now thin
  route adapters over typed service entrypoints instead of direct
  `with_repo_analysis(...)` callers
- that projected-service boundary now also owns the projected family and
  navigation cluster. `projected_page_family_context`,
  `projected_page_family_search`, `projected_page_family_cluster`,
  `projected_page_navigation`, and `projected_page_navigation_search` now
  route through one shared typed service seam instead of carrying route-local
  repository-analysis orchestration
- the remaining repo command endpoints now follow the same rule. `repo_index`,
  `repo_index_status`, and `refine_entity_doc` now delegate through one shared
  repo-command service instead of each route binding its own command or
  repository-analysis orchestration
- the next repo-handler cleanup slice has started too. The old
  `repo/shared.rs` helper surface is now split into a `repo/shared/` feature
  folder with separate repository-resolution and execution modules. The shared
  repo handler boundary now follows the same feature-folder rule as the rest of
  the repo handler surface
- the same service-consolidation rule now also covers the docs surface.
  `docs/search`, `docs/retrieval`, `docs/page`, `docs/family`, and
  `docs/navigation` now delegate through one shared `docs/service.rs`
  boundary, so docs handlers no longer own repeated route-local
  `with_repo_analysis(...)` orchestration or retrieval-hit error translation
- that docs-service boundary is now closed over the planner and gap surfaces
  too. `docs/projected-gap-report` and the full `docs/planner-*` cluster now
  delegate through the same shared service instead of binding route-local
  repository-analysis orchestration
- the last flat docs shared-state surface is now closed too. The old
  `docs/types.rs` has been replaced by a `docs/types/` feature folder with
  separate planner and projected-gap query-param modules, and route imports now
  go through the crate-qualified docs types boundary
- the flat docs route surface has now been closed as well. Projection-oriented
  docs handlers now live under `docs/projection/`, planner routes live under
  `docs/planner/`, and router re-exports keep the external endpoint surface
  unchanged
- the same closure now applies to the internal docs service layer. The old
  flat `docs/service.rs` has been replaced by `docs/service/{projection,planner,runtime}.rs`,
  so service ownership now aligns with the route and query-param boundaries
- the top router export seam is now aligned too. Docs handler re-exports live
  in `handlers/docs_exports.rs`, so the final outward-facing docs symbol
  surface is grouped instead of inlined into `handlers/mod.rs`

Phase 1 keeps the external gateway and CLI contract unchanged, but the first
repo-facing internal milestone is now complete: repo code-search and
repo-analysis fast paths both sit on Wendao-owned typed internal service
boundaries instead of route-local adapter seams. Phase 2 has also landed its
first two repo-analysis orchestration milestones, so the route layer now acts
as a thin adapter over one shared typed repo-analysis service boundary, and the
import lane now participates in that same publication-aware fast-path model.
The same consolidation pattern now spans repo, projected, command, shared, and
docs handler clusters instead of stopping at repo-analysis search alone. The
docs handler surface is now fully closed over one shared docs-service seam, and
its shared query-param and route surfaces now both follow the same
feature-folder rule. The internal docs service layer and router export seam now
follow it too. The last legacy `docs_exports.rs` barrel is gone as well, so the
outward docs handler surface now binds directly to the `docs::planner` and
`docs::projection` feature folders without an extra forwarding hop. The same is
now true for repository handlers: `repo_exports.rs` is gone, and the outward
repository handler surface binds directly to `handlers/repo/mod.rs`. The router
test surface now also pins this cleanup state: `gateway/studio/router/tests`
contains a regression test that fails if any legacy `handlers/*_exports.rs`
files reappear. The shared OpenAPI inventory now has the same kind of guard:
`gateway/openapi/paths/shared/tests.rs` fails if retired Flight-only HTTP paths
such as `/api/search/ast` or `/api/analysis/*` ever re-enter the stable route
inventory.

## 📦 Usage

### As a CLI Tool (Standalone Binary)

Build the sovereign binary:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin wendao
```

Run common operations:

```bash
# Analyze document hierarchy
./target/release/wendao page-index --path ./my_notes/paper.md

# Execute hybrid search
./target/release/wendao search "Explain quantum entanglement" --hybrid

# Show graph neighbors
./target/release/wendao neighbors "Agentic_RAG"
```

### As a Library

Add **Wendao** to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
xiuxian-wendao = { git = "https://github.com/tao3k/wenbdao.git" }
```

Initialize the engine:

```rust
let engine = WendaoEngine::builder()
    .with_storage(ValkeyConfig::default())
    .with_vectors(LanceConfig::at("./data/vectors"))
    .build()
    .await?;
```

### Optional Python Bindings

Enable the PyO3 surface only when you need Python interop:

```bash
cargo build -p xiuxian-wendao --features pybindings
```

This keeps the default build free of PyO3 and the Python-specific modules.
